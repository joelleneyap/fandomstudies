Questions for now
* network of fandoms (crossovers?)
* do the spikes in fics published on particular dates correspond with major releases e.g. avengers 2012?
* clean up graphs - some non resolved dupes in tags
* scatter plot of average fic length for various ships/fandoms
* network of interrelated tags?

DONE
* can i make a networkx social network of all the characters and relationships?
* do the spikes in fics published on particular dates correspond with major releases e.g. avengers 2012?
